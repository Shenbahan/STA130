But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

Two of the rows is missing data for one of the columns, so instead of removing that entire column, you can just remove the rows that are missing the data by using df.dropna().\n",

    "1. so df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() basically compares two of the colums in the dataset, col1 is what you will mainly be focusing on, but within that, you are looking at col2.

Now within these categories, we would get the specific statistics like the min, max, median, mean, std, count, Q1 and Q3.\n",
